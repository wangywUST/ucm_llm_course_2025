# Paper reviews

The goal of the panel reviews is to critically read and analyze the paper(s). Reviewing is a central practice in the academic community; our goal for the course is for you to have a better grasp on what constitues a strong review and how to write strong reviews for a variety of different papers. At the top level, reviews should address:
1. the main contributions of the paper(s),
2. the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and
3. questions/discussion items you have based on the work.

For this course, reviews should be a few paragraphs (in the style of a conference review, say for ACL or NeurIPS).
To provide further guidance, please refer to the [ACL Reviewer Tutorial](https://aclrollingreview.org/reviewertutorial) and the [NeurIPS Reviewer Guidelines](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2021/Reviewer-Guidelines). 

In addition, while there are many ways to write a good review, we provide two examples:

Reviews will be graded pass/fail and should be submitted by **11:00 AM PST on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/342794)** on the day of the lecture. 
For weeks when you are responsible for [paper discussions](https://stanford-cs324.github.io/winter2022/paper-discussions/), you will want to take additional time in thinking about questions/discussion items.
